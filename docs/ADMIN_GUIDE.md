---

# 1. Introduction

This guide is intended for administrators responsible for managing and maintaining the Vetri AI Multi-Agent application.

Administrators are responsible for:

* User and role management
* Permission management
* Monitoring AI agents
* Monitoring approvals
* Reviewing notifications
* Reviewing audit records
* Managing integrations
* Monitoring automation
* Supporting deployment and configuration
* Troubleshooting application issues

---

# 2. Administrator Responsibilities

The administrator should regularly monitor:

* Application availability
* User access
* User roles
* Permissions
* AI agent functionality
* Approval requests
* Notifications
* Audit records
* External integrations
* Automation
* System errors

---

# 3. User Management

The application provides a User Roles API for retrieving user-role information.

**Endpoint**

```http
GET /api/user-roles/
```

**Authentication:** Required.

Administrators should ensure that users are assigned appropriate roles according to their responsibilities.

Users should not receive permissions that are unnecessary for their work.

---

# 4. Role Management

Roles are used to control access to business functionality.

The role and permission system should follow the principle of least privilege.

Administrators should:

1. Review available users.
2. Review their assigned roles.
3. Verify that the assigned permissions are appropriate.
4. Remove unnecessary access.
5. Review access whenever a user's responsibilities change.

---

# 5. Permission Management

The Permission Engine controls access to business operations.

**Endpoint**

```http
GET /api/permissions/
```

**Authentication:** Required.

Administrators should verify that restricted operations are accessible only to authorized users.

Permission checks are particularly important for sensitive business actions.

---

# 6. AI Agent Management

The application uses a multi-agent architecture.

Registered agents include:

* Calendar Agent
* HR Agent
* Sales Agent
* Project Agent
* Finance Agent
* Marketing Agent
* Developer Agent
* QA Agent
* Operations Agent
* Reporting Agent
* GitHub Agent

The Agent Registry API can be used to retrieve the available agents.

**Endpoint**

```http
GET /api/agents/
```

**Authentication:** Required.

Administrators should verify that expected agents are available after deployment or configuration changes.

---

# 7. AI Agent Monitoring

When troubleshooting AI requests, administrators should check the following flow:

```text
User Request
     ↓
Django Chat API
     ↓
AI Orchestrator
     ↓
Agent Registry
     ↓
Specialized Agent
     ↓
Tool / Data Source
     ↓
Response
```

If an AI request fails, determine which layer produced the error.

Possible problem areas include:

* Authentication
* Orchestrator routing
* Agent processing
* Tool execution
* Database access
* External integrations
* AI/LLM configuration

---

# 8. Approval Workflow Administration

Sensitive actions require approval before execution.

Current sensitive actions include:

* `send_email`
* `send_bulk_message`
* `approve_leave`
* `financial_change`
* `deploy`
* `delete_data`

The workflow is:

```text
Sensitive Request
      ↓
Approval Created
      ↓
Pending Notification
      ↓
User Review
      ↓
Approve / Edit / Cancel
      ↓
Tool Execution
      ↓
Execution Notification
      ↓
Audit Log
```

Administrators should monitor pending approval requests and investigate unexpected or failed executions.

---

# 9. Approval API

The approval system provides the following operations.

### List Approvals

```http
GET /api/approvals/
```

### Filter Approvals

```http
GET /api/approvals/?status=pending
```

### Create Approval Preview

```http
POST /api/approvals/preview/
```

### View Approval

```http
GET /api/approvals/<action_id>/
```

### Approve Action

```http
POST /api/approvals/<action_id>/approve/
```

### Edit Approval

```http
PUT /api/approvals/<action_id>/edit/
```

### Cancel Approval

```http
POST /api/approvals/<action_id>/cancel/
```

All approval endpoints require authentication.

---

# 10. Approval Failure Handling

A sensitive action may be approved successfully but still fail during tool execution.

For example, an email action may fail when required recipient information is missing.

Example:

```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Recipient is required."
}
```

Administrators should review the approval result and audit record when an execution fails.

The approval system records execution results so that failures can be investigated.

---

# 11. Notification Management

Notifications provide information about important application events.

Notifications can include:

* Approval requests
* Approved actions
* Executed actions
* Project risks
* High-priority leads
* Overdue payments
* Customer issues
* Deadlines
* Intelligent alerts

Notification APIs are restricted to the authenticated user's notifications.

---

# 12. Notification APIs

### List Notifications

```http
GET /api/notifications/
```

### Notification Details

```http
GET /api/notifications/<id>/
```

### Mark Notification as Read

```http
PUT /api/notifications/<id>/read/
```

All notification endpoints require authentication.

---

# 13. Audit Logging

The audit logging system provides traceability for important system operations.

Audit records contain:

* User
* Agent
* Request
* Data accessed
* Tool
* Action
* Approval
* Result
* Timestamp

The audit log API is:

```http
GET /api/audit-logs/
```

The current audit log view does not enforce authentication. This should be considered when hardening the production application.

Administrators should protect audit information because it may contain sensitive operational details.

---

# 14. Reviewing Audit Records

Audit records can be used to investigate:

* Who performed an action
* Which agent processed the request
* Which tool was used
* What action was requested
* Whether approval was required
* Whether approval was granted
* Whether execution succeeded or failed
* When the action occurred

A typical approval workflow may produce records such as:

```text
Required - Pending
        ↓
Approved
        ↓
Approved - Executed
```

Administrators should review unusual or unexpected records.

---

# 15. Google Calendar Administration

The application integrates with Google Calendar using OAuth 2.0.

The available endpoints are:

```http
GET /api/calendar/login/
GET /api/calendar/oauth2callback/
GET /api/calendar/test/
```

The OAuth flow is:

```text
Application
     ↓
Google OAuth Login
     ↓
User Authorization
     ↓
OAuth Callback
     ↓
Credentials Stored in Session
     ↓
Calendar API
```

---

# 16. Google Calendar Troubleshooting

Common OAuth problems include:

### Redirect URI Mismatch

If Google reports:

```text
redirect_uri_mismatch
```

verify that the callback URL configured in Google Cloud exactly matches the callback URL used by the application.

### Access Denied

If Google reports:

```text
access_denied
```

check:

* OAuth consent configuration
* Test users
* Google Cloud project configuration
* Requested permissions

### Calendar Connection Failure

Use the Calendar Test endpoint:

```http
GET /api/calendar/test/
```

Review the backend logs if the integration fails.

---

# 17. Automation Administration

Vetri AI provides automation endpoints for generating reminders and intelligent alerts.

## Generate Reminders

```http
POST /api/automation/reminders/
```

**Authentication:** Required.

The endpoint generates automated reminders based on available business information.

## Generate Intelligent Alerts

```http
POST /api/automation/alerts/
```

**Authentication:** Required.

The endpoint generates alerts based on important business conditions.

---

# 18. Automation Monitoring

Administrators should monitor automated reminders and alerts for:

* Duplicate notifications
* Incorrect information
* Missing business data
* Unexpected alert volume
* Failed generation
* Incorrect business conditions

Automation should be reviewed after major changes to business data or agent logic.

---

# 19. Backend Administration

The Django backend can be checked using:

```powershell
python manage.py check
```

Run database migrations when required:

```powershell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

The application should be restarted after relevant backend configuration changes.

---

# 20. Production Configuration

Production configuration should be stored securely.

Administrators should manage:

* Django secret key
* Debug configuration
* Allowed hosts
* CORS configuration
* Database configuration

* Email configuration
* AI/LLM credentials
* Other required environment variables

Sensitive credentials must never be committed to GitHub.

---

# 21. Security Administration

Administrators should:

* Use strong authentication credentials.
* Apply least-privilege access.
* Protect sensitive business operations.
* Review approval requests.
* Monitor audit records.
* Protect API credentials.
* Protect OAuth credentials.
* Avoid exposing secrets in frontend code.
* Configure production CORS correctly.
* Use HTTPS.
* Keep dependencies updated.
* Disable debug mode in production.
* Monitor failed authentication and unexpected operations.

---

# 22. Deployment Administration

The application is deployed using Render and source code is maintained in GitHub.

A typical deployment workflow is:

```text

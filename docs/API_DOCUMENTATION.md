# 18. Security

The application uses JWT authentication for protected API operations.

Security mechanisms include:

* JWT-based authentication
* Role-based access control
* Permission Engine
* User-specific conversation access
* User-specific notification access
* Approval workflow for sensitive actions
* Audit logging
* OAuth authentication for Google Calendar

Sensitive actions are protected by the approval workflow before execution.

Important system actions are recorded through the audit logging system.

---

# 19. AI Agent Architecture

The AI system follows a multi-agent architecture.

A typical request follows:

```text
User
  ↓
React AI Chat
  ↓
Django Chat API
  ↓
AI Orchestrator
  ↓
Agent Registry
  ↓
Specialized Agent
  ↓
Tool / Data Source
  ↓
Response
  ↓
User
```

For sensitive actions:

```text
User Request
     ↓
AI Orchestrator
     ↓
Agent
     ↓
Tool
     ↓
Approval Required
     ↓
Notification
     ↓
User Approval
     ↓
Tool Execution
     ↓
Notification
     ↓
Audit Log
```

This architecture separates AI routing, business agents, tools, approvals, notifications, and audit tracking.

---

# 20. Error Handling

API errors generally return an appropriate HTTP status code and JSON response containing status and message information.

Example:

```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Recipient is required."
}
```

Clients should handle:

* Authentication failures
* Missing required parameters
* Validation errors
* Unauthorized access
* Integration failures
* Tool execution errors
* Invalid conversation IDs
* Invalid approval actions

Errors generated during tool execution are recorded as part of the approval and audit workflow where applicable.

---

# 21. Testing

The API and major project functionality have been tested for:

* Authentication
* JWT login
* AI Chat
* Finance Agent
* Project Agent
* Reporting Agent
* Calendar Agent
* Google Calendar OAuth
* Approval workflow
* Approval notifications
* Approval execution notifications
* Audit logging
* Automation reminders
* Intelligent alerts

Approval workflow testing verified the creation of pending approvals, approval execution, notifications, and audit records.

Additional security, unauthorized-access, integration-failure, and AI evaluation testing remain part of the final testing phase.

---
